#PLANNING

- The  first initial step I took was to look over some current clothing websites and have a look at how they have branded their products and how the webapp has been laid out. I decided after reading through the brief that using React would be the appropiate tool to use to build my app.

- Once decided on the language, I followed on with planning, which involved a trello board, sketches of the interface of the app and functions, linking them both to clearly visualize how I was to approach the build of the app.


#TO BE COMPLETED

- I felt the planning was very beneficial to setting myself up to build the app:

 to do:
 
  - add item to basket
  - remove item from basket
  - Use vouchers/view new total cost
  - Alert user if voucher is invalid
  - Can't add item if out of stock
